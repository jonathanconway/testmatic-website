# Introduction

Testmatic is a test-case manager for quickly writing and organising human-readable test cases.

- ✅ simple lists of [**_steps_**](/docs/concepts/tests-and-steps)
- 🧪 are grouped into [**_tests_**](/docs/concepts/tests-and-steps)
- 🏷️ which can be organised by [**_tags_**](/docs/concepts/tags)
- 🏃 with results tracked in [**_runs_**](/docs/concepts/runs)

Everything is stored in Markdown files, for easy viewing, editing, searching and version control. If pushed to a server, links to Markdown files can be shared within your org, via e.g. Wiki pages, Chat posts, email, etc.

The main benefit of using Testmatic is that it helps you to perform [manual testing](/docs/topics/benefits-of-manual-testing) in an organised, consistent, rigorous, systematic manner.

Manual testing can offer fast benefits when automated test coverage is limited, development time is constrained and rapid delivery is required while minimising defects.

Whenever you are ready to add automation, Testmatic can help you there too: code generators automatically convert your test cases into unit test files.
