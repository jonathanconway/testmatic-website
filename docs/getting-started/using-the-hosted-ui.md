# Using the hosted UI

If you just want to play around with Testmatic or use it lightly, you can immediately get started with the hosted UI.

The hosted UI can be used immediately, without any local installation.

Simply navigate to: http://testmatic.surge.sh and begin adding your tests.

You can find instructions for using the hosted UI at [UI guide](/docs/category/ui-guide).
