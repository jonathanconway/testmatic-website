# Collaboration in manual testing

Traditionally, manual testing was mainly performed by QA engineers, using sophisticated test case tools.

However, as products become more complex, an increasing burden of testing falls on developers/engineers and others on the team.

- Engineers perform manual testing to understand what they're building, why they're building it, how people will use it, etc.
- Engineers perform manual testing to ensure their code actually works as expected
- Product owners perform manual testing to understand how people use the product, identify issues and bottlenecks and ideate on future directions for the product
- Designers perform manual testing to see how the system looks and feels and identify areas for improvement, such as making the experience more consistent and cohesive
