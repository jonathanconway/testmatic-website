# Benefits of everyone doing a little testing

While specialisation is good for productivity, a blinkered or siloed approach to **testing** may not be optimal.

- More (and a variety of) eyes on a product are more likely to uncover errors.
- Errors (or important ones at least) eventually need to be fixed and this will likely involve engineers. It will likely be easier for engineers to fix errors if they already have a good grasp on key test cases and are generally capable testers themselves.
- Fixes may come in various forms, not necessarily engineering. E.g. a small error in pricing might be cheaper to fix by simply adjusting copy in an email to alert users, rather than consuming expensive engineer-hours.
- Engineers who understand test cases can gain a more holistic understanding of the system they are working on. Rather than just focussing on structure / code, engineers can think of how the software is being used and tailor their efforts accordingly. E.g. prioritisation of work, code structure, data structure selection, time estimates, long-term goal-setting.
