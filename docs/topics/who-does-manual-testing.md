# Who does manual testing?

Simple manual testing, such as clicking around, is often done by developers/engineers as the build the product.

More advanced testing is often outsourced to QA departments, who use sophisticated test case tools.

However, as products become more complex, an increasing burden of testing falls on developers/engineers and others on the team.

Testmatic fills this middle-ground between casual/informal testing and professional QA.
