# What is manual testing?

Manual testing is using an application yourself to ensure it works well.

It can be as simple as opening the app or website and clicking around to check that everything works.

In more complicated cases, it can involve systematic, rigorous testing, such as going through the entire sign-up flow to ensure that it works correctly.
