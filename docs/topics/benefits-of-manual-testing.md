# Benefits of manual testing

There is much agreement that **unit testing** is beneficial, but what about manual testing?

Manual testing provides unique benefits:

- Manual testing helps you discover and document **intended behaviour** â€“ how the system is **expected** to behave.
- Manual test cases can be written **immediately**, without setting up test frameworks, etc.
- Manual testing can be done in **any environment** you have access to.
- Manual testing **puts you in the end-user's shoes**, letting you experience the system as an end-user would.
- Manual testing lets you **verify complex, lengthy workflows**, which might be too difficult to automate.
