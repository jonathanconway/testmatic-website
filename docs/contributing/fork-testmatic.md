# Fork Testmatic

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the testmatic/testmatic repository.
2. In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.
3. Under "Owner," select the dropdown menu and click an owner for the forked repository.
4. By default, forks are named the same as their upstream repositories. Optionally, to further distinguish your fork, in the "Repository name" field, type a name.
5. Optionally, in the "Description" field, type a description of your fork.
6. Optionally, select Copy the DEFAULT branch only.
7. For many forking scenarios, such as contributing to open-source projects, you only need to copy the default branch. If you do not select this option, all branches will be copied into the new fork.
8. Click Create fork.

You can then checkout to a local folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/myname/mytestmatic
```

And install the dependencies using npm.

```bash
npm install
```

Congratulations! You now have a working Testmatic project.
