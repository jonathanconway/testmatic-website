# Runs

After you have written a test you might follow the steps of that test any number of times, to ensure the system is behaving correctly.

What if you want to keep track of the results? This is what **test runs** are for.

Each test can have multiple runs. Each run has a date/time stamp indicating when it was performed as well as a result and a list of checked/unchecked test steps.

You can mark each run with a **result**:

- _Passed_ - the system behaved correctly
- _Failed_ - there was some problem so the whole test failed
- _Mixed_ - some steps passed, some failed
- _Unset_ - you haven't performed the test yet

You can also check off individual test steps as you go through the run. This could be useful when making a screen recording, to show which steps have been executed, or just to keep track of the steps.

Each run has a date/time stamped folder containing the run file.

You can put screenshots or screen recording files into this folder as well. That way they will be easier to locate if/when you need them.

Runs are a powerful feature for measuring and organising your test results. You can quickly see which tests have passed or failed and keep your screen recordings organised.
