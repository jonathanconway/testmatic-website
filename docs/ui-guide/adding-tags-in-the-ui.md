You can add tags to steps or to the test as a whole.

#### Adding tags to steps

Focus on the step textbox and type in an "open backet" - `(`. Enter your tag name. Then type in "close bracket" - `)`.

You'll notice that a suggestion box appears – feel free to use this to quickly insert pre-existing tags.

- Keyboard - You can navigate with arrow keys and select a tag with the enter/return or tab key.
- Mouse - You can scroll up/down and click one of the tags in the list
